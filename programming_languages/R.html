<h2 id="r">R</h2>
<p>R is a programming language for statistical computing and data visualization. It has been adopted in the fields of data mining, bioinformatics and data analysis.
The core R language is augmented by a large number of extension packages, containing reusable code, documentation, and sample data.
R software is open-source and free software. It is licensed by the GNU Project and available under the GNU General Public License. It is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself. Precompiled executables are provided for various operating systems.
As an interpreted language, R has a native command line interface. Moreover, multiple third-party graphical user interfaces are available, such as RStudio—an integrated development environment—and Jupyter—a notebook interface.
